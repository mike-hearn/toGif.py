# toGif.py

toGif.py is a command-line tool for converting any video that is playable with ffmpeg into an animated GIF.

### Requirements

This tool requires the following programs:

* ffmpeg
* ImageMagick (specifically `convert`)
* gifsicle

On Unix-based machines, all three can be installed via package manager. For OS X, I recommend using [homebrew][1] and for Linux variants use your OS's default package manager.
